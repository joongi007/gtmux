//! Hub — PtyBackend wrapper + WS-facing fan-out channels.
//!
//! After ADR-0013 (PTY direct, no tmux) the old per-Event hub model is gone.
//! The replacement responsibilities are narrow:
//!
//! - **layout_events** — broadcast a 16-byte ETag every time the layout
//!   JSON is overwritten on disk. Consumed by the WS handler so the SPA
//!   can revalidate via `If-None-Match` (kept identical to the legacy API
//!   so `gtmux_http_api` did not need to change shape — see line 122/144
//!   of `crates/http-api/src/lib.rs`).
//! - **pane_output** — single multiplexed `(PaneId, Bytes)` broadcast.
//!   Internally a background task subscribes to every Pane's per-pane
//!   broadcast in [`gtmux_pty_backend`] and forwards the bytes here,
//!   so the WS handler can drive ALL panes off one `select!` arm
//!   without dynamic `StreamMap` gymnastics.
//! - **backend access** — [`Hub::backend`] exposes the supervisor so the
//!   WS handler can call `send_input`, `resize`, `kill`, `spawn`, etc.,
//!   and so test code can inspect pane state without a custom shim.
//!
//! Catch-up replay (per-pane ring buffer flush at WS attach) is owned by
//! the WS handler itself, *not* by Hub — the handler iterates
//! `backend.pane_ids()` and calls `backend.subscribe_output(id).0` to get
//! the ring snapshot. Putting the catch-up in Hub would force per-subscriber
//! state that the broadcast model would never naturally express.
